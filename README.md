MyStore Project Overview
MyStore is Angular application that allows users to view a list of available products to purchase, add them to a shopping cart, and ultimately complete the checkout process.


Project features
this application reflects the same user experience as that of a real-world e-commerce website, including a(n):

Product list page, which displays the available products for the user to choose and add to their cart (in various quantities)
Product details page, which displays more information about any particular product
Shopping cart, which includes the products that the user has added to their cart
Checkout form, which collects information about the user (e.g., name, address, payment details, etc.)
Order confirmation page, which shows the outcome after the user completes the checkout process (i.e., submits the checkout form)
